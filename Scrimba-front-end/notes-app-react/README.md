# Markdown Notes App

## Description

The goal of this project was to add features to an existing project provided by Scrimba. The challenge was to make sense of code I didn't write myself and then add new features to it. I navigated through the unfamiliar codebase, piecing together how things worked. Along the way, I introduced new features that enhance the app's capabilities and make it even more useful. 

Features I added:
- LocalStorage (later upgraded to firebase)
- Note summary titles
- Move modified notes to the top of the list
- Delete notes

Features Added under guidance:
- Sync data to firebase
- Debouncing
