## Description

The goal of this project was to build a Quizz game using React to practice forms, fetching APIs, `useState`, `props` and `useEffect`. The development process involved translating a Figma design, which was provided, into a functional app from scratch. The project served as an opportunity to apply newly acquired React skills towards web development.
